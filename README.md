# Emacs Custom Configuration

Now that I've grown more familiar with Emacs, and found some really useful packages, I'm ready to replace the hacked-up version of "Emacs 24 Starter Kit" I had been using with my own customization system.

Goals are:

1. Simplify the initialization code to just what I use, and leave out
   a lot of obsolete code for the starter kit.

2. Produce a set of initialization files which are both useful to me,
   and useful to new-ish users of Emacs looking for an example
   configuration setup to learn from.

   a. The aim is not so much to have the user install this as their
      Emacs configuration (though I suppose they could), as to empower
      him or her to create their own customization files that are
      powerful yet easy to understand.
