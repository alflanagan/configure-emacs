** Declarations

Tell byte-compiler about functions it might see.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (declare-function php-eldoc-enable "php-eldoc" ())
  (declare-function use-package "use-package" (name &rest args))
#+END_SRC

** Load Packages

Some of us are forced to work with PHP even though we'd much rather
not. ;-) For those poor souls there's `php-mode` and some handy
extras.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; note there is a `php+-mode` but it was last updated in 2012
  (use-package "php-mode"  ;; Major mode for editing PHP code 
    :ensure t
    :defer)

  (use-package "php-eldoc"  ;; eldoc backend for php 
    :ensure t
    :defer
    :config (add-hook 'php-init-hook (lambda ()
                                       (php-eldoc-enable)
                                       (eldoc-mode 1))))

  (use-package "php-extras"  ;; Extra features for `php-mode'
    :ensure t
    :defer)

  (use-package "php-refactor-mode"
    ;; Minor mode to quickly and safely perform common refactorings
    :ensure t
    :defer)

  (use-package "php-scratch"
    ;; A scratch buffer to interactively evaluate php code
    :ensure t
    :defer)

#+END_SRC
