# Local Customizations

This code is run to set up Emacs for the local environment.

** Set frame (window) size

Emacs calls the window displaying one or more buffers a
"frame". Someday I need to write a function to set the frame size
based on the dimensions of the screen.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (set-frame-size (selected-frame) 140 45)
#+end_src
